# Inventory Tracking Module Architecture

## Overview

The `@company/inventory-tracking` module provides comprehensive inventory management functionality for e-commerce applications. It follows a CRUD pattern with ultra-fine-grained architecture, separating concerns across entities, repositories, services, and controllers.

## Core Components

### 1. Entities
- **WarehouseEntity**: Represents physical warehouse locations
- **ProductInventoryEntity**: Tracks product stock levels per warehouse
- **StockReservationEntity**: Manages temporary stock reservations
- **StockMovementEntity**: Records all stock movements
- **StockAlertEntity**: Handles inventory alerts and notifications

### 2. Services
- **InventoryService**: Core inventory management operations
- **WarehouseService**: Warehouse CRUD and capacity management
- **ReservationService**: Stock reservation lifecycle management
- **StockMovementService**: Movement tracking and history
- **AlertService**: Alert configuration and notification dispatch

### 3. Key Features

#### Multi-Warehouse Support
- Track inventory across multiple locations
- Warehouse capacity management
- Inter-warehouse transfers

#### Stock Reservations
- Temporary stock holds for orders
- Automatic expiry handling
- Reservation confirmation/cancellation

#### Alert System
- Low stock alerts
- Expiry warnings
- Overstock notifications
- Configurable thresholds

#### Audit Trail
- Complete movement history
- Reason tracking
- User attribution

## Data Flow

1. **Stock Adjustment Flow**
   ```
   Client -> Controller -> InventoryService -> Repository -> Database
                        -> MovementService (audit)
                        -> AlertService (notifications)
   ```

2. **Reservation Flow**
   ```
   Client -> Controller -> ReservationService -> Repository -> Database
                        -> InventoryService (update available stock)
                        -> EventEmitter (notifications)
   ```

3. **Transfer Flow**
   ```
   Client -> Controller -> InventoryService -> Validate warehouses
                        -> Update source inventory
                        -> Update destination inventory
                        -> MovementService (record transfer)
                        -> WarehouseService (update occupancy)
   ```

## Integration Points

### Dependencies
- `@company/core`: Base classes and utilities
- `@company/types`: Shared type definitions
- `@company/utils`: Common utilities
- `@company/database`: Database abstractions
- `@company/api-client`: HTTP client
- `@company/cache`: Caching layer

### Events
The module emits events for key operations:
- Stock level changes
- Reservation lifecycle
- Alert triggers
- Warehouse capacity warnings

### External Integrations
- Product catalog (for product details)
- Order management (for reservations)
- Notification service (for alerts)
- Analytics (for reporting)

## Performance Considerations

1. **Caching**
   - Inventory levels cached for 5 minutes
   - Warehouse data cached for 10 minutes
   - Cache invalidation on updates

2. **Database Optimization**
   - Indexed on productId, warehouseId
   - Composite indexes for common queries
   - Partitioning for movement history

3. **Batch Operations**
   - Bulk stock adjustments
   - Batch reservation processing
   - Aggregated alert checking

## Security

1. **Access Control**
   - Role-based permissions
   - Warehouse-level access
   - Audit logging

2. **Data Validation**
   - Zod schemas for all inputs
   - Business rule validation
   - Referential integrity checks

## Scalability

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Stateless services
   - Distributed caching
   - Event-driven architecture

2. **Data Partitioning**
   - Movement history by date
   - Inventory by warehouse
   - Alerts by product category

## Monitoring

Key metrics to track:
- Stock accuracy
- Reservation fulfillment rate
- Alert response time
- Warehouse utilization
- Movement processing time
